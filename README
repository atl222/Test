Note : This is a learning project.

=============================================================================== 

Reason :

MP-CD (Multi Purpose - Compiling Device) project is a DOS coded program that was mainly started to create a
program that would compile different MaNGOS Cores (In early stages , and other
emulator cores later). It allows you to compile a clean MaNGOS core from github
and any core of your selection from github.                                            

===============================================================================

Functions :

MP-CD Application (UI.bat)currently allows you to compile different emulator
cores(explained above), restart any emulator servers (MaNGOS , ArcEmu , 
Ascent....), update your database , execute different SQL files , Portable Calculator , or just relax
with a game of Hangman - Those are the currently working functions , a lot more
will functions will be added over time.

===============================================================================

Will update README file over time.
